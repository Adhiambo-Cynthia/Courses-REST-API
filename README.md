### Requirements
* Knowledge of Django
* Basic Knowledge on REST API's
### Set up
pip install ```django``` and ```django-rest``` in your virtual environment and set up the project, an app with some Models normally. Migrate the Models to synnc it with the database.

### Understanding Django Rest
* #### Serialization
Serializers basically work in such a way to convert complex data from/to the database tables into/from the API JSON format.

### Testing Our API
To test if our API can acqually receive requests from clients, we use [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
This ensures that our backend can communicate with whichever front-end service there is, from web to android to desktop front-ends.
